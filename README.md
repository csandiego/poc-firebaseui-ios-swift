A simple iOS app for trying out Firebase Authentication written in Swift.

## Setup

### 1. Get the code, create a Firebase project and register an iOS app

Instructions can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup). Only steps 1, 2 and 3 are required. Then run `pod install` and open the xcworkspace file.

### 2. Enable Password Authentication and Google Sign-In

In the **Auth** section of the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), under the **Sign in method** tab, enable the **Email/password** and **Google** sign in methods.

### 3. Run using Xcode

Xcode can install and run the app in a simulator or a physical device.
